<br>


## ⋆˙⟡ File Format

Upload one of the supported formats: **CSV, TXT, or TSV**.

### One column

The same value is used for both the **label text** and the **QR code content**.

### Two columns

* **Column 1:** Label text
* **Column 2:** QR code content

### More than two columns

* **Column 1:** Label text
* **Columns 2+ :** Combined together (separated by line breaks) and encoded into the QR code.

👉 **Example input files and sample generated labels can be found in the `examples/` folder.**

<br>

## ⋆˙⟡ Output

The app generates a **print-ready PDF** containing all generated labels.

<br>

## ⋆˙⟡ Features

* Supports emojis (🎉❤️)
* Handles multilingual characters, including:

  * Japanese (お茶)
  * Chinese (中文)
  * Korean (한국)
  * Russian (Москва)
  * Mathematical symbols (∫π∑)
  * Accented characters

> Due to font limitations, only ASCII characters are fully guaranteed for label text rendering.
> Non-ASCII characters work best inside the QR code content.

<br>

## ⋆˙⟡ Encoding Notes

To avoid character display issues, make sure your file is encoded as **UTF-8**:

* **Google Sheets:** `File → Download → CSV` (recommended)
* **Excel:** `Save As → CSV UTF-8 (comma-delimited)`
